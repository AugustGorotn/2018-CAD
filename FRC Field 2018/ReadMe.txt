This Zip file contains the FRC 2018 Playing field "Power Up" in Solidworks 2016 format. It was originally created by Autodesk (Thank you!) and saved in various formats. I downloaded the STEP file & saved in SolidWorks. It created over 360 unique parts (FRC fields are complicated!). So I saved the major assemblies as 4 unique parts:

	Field
	Scale Arm
	Switch Arm
	Cube

The Field lost some small internal details when I saved "Exterior Faces Only" but I don't think they're important. 

The cubes are not constrained; you can move them anywhere. The Field assembly has 2 configurations: Arms Level and Arms Tilted. 

I hope this helps your team. Good luck!
